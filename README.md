# kaly42-custom-keymap
This is my own keymap for the Kaly42 keyboard that uses QMK Firmware.

In order to test the keymap, you should have qmk install & setup on your local machine as prrequisite.

Step to reproduce/use my keymap:
1. download the custom directory
2. copy it on the following path: ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/kaly/kaly42/keymaps
3. run qmk compile command 
4. run qmk flash command
